/**
 * Provider "ports" — the explicit contracts the app depends on.
 *
 * These interfaces are the inward-facing boundary of the anti-corruption
 * layer. The app (queries, pages) is written against THESE shapes, never
 * against a vendor's API. Each concrete adapter (btc.ts, eth.ts, prices.ts,
 * …) is the outward-facing half: it talks to one specific vendor, maps that
 * vendor's payload onto the domain types from `@stackr/models`, and validates
 * the result before returning. Swapping a vendor (Blockstream → mempool.space,
 * Etherscan → Alchemy) is then a change to a single adapter, with the port —
 * and therefore every call site — untouched.
 *
 * The interfaces deliberately speak only in `@stackr/models` domain types.
 * No vendor response interface appears here; that is the whole point.
