# Stackr

**A cross-chain Web3 portfolio for self-custodial holders.**

Track your real holdings across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Stacks, and Sui in one
view — connected wallets, watch-only addresses, and stablecoin positions
unified with live prices, depth-aware charts, and a trading-terminal aesthetic
built for people who actually use crypto.

## What stackr is

Most portfolio trackers force a trade-off: hosted convenience with a KYC
wall, or DIY self-custody with no useful UI. Stackr is built on the premise
that the right answer is _self-custody by default, hosted nothing, beautiful
anyway_.

Connect MetaMask, Phantom, or Leather and your holdings render in seconds —
ETH, ERC-20s, SOL, SPL tokens, BTC, STX, Stacks fungibles, BNS names, ENS
names, stacking positions, FIAT-pegged stablecoins. Or add watch-only
addresses (cold storage, a partner's stack, a trading wallet) with custom
labels and groups. Everything is computed client-side from public chain RPCs;
no account, no database, no custody, no tracking pixels — only
privacy-preserving, PII-free product analytics, and only when you opt in by
configuring a key.

## Features

- **Multi-chain by default** — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Stacks, Sui. Stable
  coins and FIAT-pegged tokens treated as first-class citizens.
- **Connected + watch-only unified** — your hardware wallet, your hot wallet,
  and your partner's address all in one portfolio view.
- **Realtime market data** — Kraken-backed orderbook + depth chart, live
  price ticks, hand-rolled SVG charts that don't choke on 10+ updates/sec.
- **ENS / `.sol` / `.btc` resolution** — names where addresses would normally
  blur into noise.
- **EUR + USD** — because Dublin.
- **No accounts, privacy-preserving analytics, no PII** — watch-only addresses
  live in `localStorage`. Connected wallets are auth + address-discovery only;
  stackr never signs transactions. Optional product analytics are PII-free by
  design: no addresses, balances, fiat amounts, or names ever leave the device,
  autocapture and session replay are off, and Do Not Track is respected.
- **Mobile-first** — designed for 375px and up; a native iOS + Android wallet
  app (Expo) is in development in `apps/mobile`.
